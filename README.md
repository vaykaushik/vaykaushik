ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vaykaushik

ðŸ‘€ Currently, I am on a quest to improve my Javascript and React skills to build interesting looking front-end applications. 
    Long-term, I want to be able to create applications on React Native for android devices. But so far, I have been 
    practicing mostly vanilla Javascript with a little bit of React.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript & React as well as a whole host of other adhoc technologies. There are simply too many to list here haha
